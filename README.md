Hello All! 

This is my take on a simple yet fun Wordle for kids!

There are so many wordle clones out there now, but not many tailored towards kids, I wanted to try to fix that. 

There is still much that can be done to this project to make it more kid friendly, but for now, 3 letter words and 6 tries paired with a little color should be well enough. 

Feel free to email me about anything regarding this site!
